Hello! My name is Isaiah Levy, and I'm a senior with an interest in Software Development. My passion lies in the world of coding and the endless possibilities it presents for innovation and problem-solving. I'm particularly drawn to the open-source community, where collaboration and knowledge sharing thrive. As I continue my CS journey, I'm eager to contribute to and improve open source projects, believing that through collective effort, we can create technology that is accessible, robust, and benefits everyone.
