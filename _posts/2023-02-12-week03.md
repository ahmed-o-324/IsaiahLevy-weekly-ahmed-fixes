title: Week 3 - Git, Team Efforts, Our Weather Extension
---

## Git Exercises

We tackled some Git exercises in class, focusing on working in a repo where multiple people push changes. The key takeaway was learning to use an upstream remote to keep our work in sync and prevent merge conflicts. It was all about getting comfortable with merging changes from the origin regularly.

## Browser Extension Project

On the project front, we're building a weather extension. It's been smooth sailing with the team—no issues yet. We've laid the groundwork with a `manifest.json`, a `background.js` for fetching weather data, and started thinking about the UI.

### My Role

I feel my biggest impact has been drafting the background.js script. I’ve set the stage for how our extension interacts with weather data sources/api and manages this data within the browser environment.
