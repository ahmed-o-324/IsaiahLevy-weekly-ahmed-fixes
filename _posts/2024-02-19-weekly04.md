title: Week 4 - Reflecting on Our Browser Extension Project
---

### Teamwork

Our group divided tasks to avoid stepping on each other's toes, which helped prevent any merge conflicts or accidental overwrites. This process underscored the importance of clear communication and trust. 

### My Contributions

My roll was setting up the API logic and creating the initial `manifest.json`. 

### New Insights and Self-Reflection

One of the lessons from this project was getting more comfortable with the use of an upstream branch for more effective version control, moving away from the direct pushes to the main branch that I was accustomed to. 


### Observations from Other Teams

 A particular favorite of mine was a study tool extension that cleverly used videos from popular culture to maintain focus. Its humorous approach made it stand out. However, the TikTok extension for managing study and break times struck me as the most practical. It's a tool I'm considering adding to my browser.
