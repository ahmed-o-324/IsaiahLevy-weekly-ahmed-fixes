### Update on Open Food Facts

I've finished working on my first issue and am now in the process of making a pull request. Initially, diving into the code base to make changes felt overwhelming, but I'm starting to get more comfortable with the overall structure. The team meetings have been beneficial, although we could improve by organizing our schedules a bit more. I'm looking forward to seeing if my changes are accepted and to tackling more issues.
