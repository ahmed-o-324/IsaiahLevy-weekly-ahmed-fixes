### Diving into Open Source with Open Food Facts

This week, my group and I decided to contribute to the Open Food Facts as our project. We were looking for a project with plenty of opportunities to help out, and this one seemed like a good fit. The community around it seems friendly, which is a big plus for us.

It's interesting to think about how the open-source movement started. It's a mix of different people: techies, legal experts, and just regular folks who believe in sharing and improving software together.
