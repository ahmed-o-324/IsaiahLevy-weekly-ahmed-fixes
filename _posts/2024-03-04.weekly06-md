Exploring various projects has been eye-opening, highlighting the vast range of contributions possible across numerous technologies and initiatives. The excitement for me lies in the potential to significantly impact an open source technology, ultimately enhancing people's lives in one way or another. However, navigating the expansive code bases of these projects presents a considerable challenge, as they can be daunting. I think that a good way to tackle this by pinpointing specific issues we want to address, allowing us to focus on relevant portions of the code base without being overwhelmed by its entirety.
