## Open Source
When I hear the term "Open Source," I think of collective effort. An intriguing way to develop technology is by allowing for the most use cases and modifications to the software. Everyone has an incentive to use, improve, and maintain the software, and each contribution is beneficial for society as a whole.

I chose to take this course because I wanted to have a tangible impact on software that is commonly used. This will give me the opportunity to leverage the theory and skills I have learned in previous classes and apply them to improving a technology.

## Projects
1. **Git**: I frequently use GitHub as a version control system, along with its collaborative tools, to develop group projects, software, etc.

2. **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Both have been fundamental to many data science projects I have worked on. They are also embedded into many other libraries/packages that I frequently use, including Pandas.

3. **Docker**: Docker was crucial for me to containerize and deploy software that I built during my summer internship.

4. **Apache Web Server**: Every website I have developed has relied on the Apache Web Server. This is probably the most important Open Source Software, as it plays a key role in the infrastructure of the World Wide Web.
